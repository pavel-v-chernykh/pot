===================

The Power of Two Puzzle can be regarded as a type of
[sliding tile puzzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_block_puzzle).

with undo functionality.

I've developed it using the next technology stack

 * [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
 * [Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om)
 * [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async)
